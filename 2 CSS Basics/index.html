          <h1>Chief Ford's Culinary Guide to Miami</h1>
          <p>In cities like Miami, where the food scene is largely dominated by hotel restaurants, it can be difficult for outsiders to separate the truly great menus from the more standard hotel-style fare.</p>

            <h3>Style Agenda: LA’s East and West Sides</h3>
            <p class="clip-lines-3">We’re not against being tourists in our own city, especially during the holidays. (A walk along the beach, followed by ice cream at Salt & Straw? We’ll take it.) One major benefit of living in LA is the diversity of its neighborhoods: Downtown LA is constantly changing, having recently evolved into a vibrant destination known for its inventive food scene and cool lifestyle shops; whereas the West Side can’t be beat with its easy access to the beach, family-friendly activities, and charming neighborhood blocks. Here, what to do (and wear) should you find yourself on either part of town.</p>

            <h3>The Detroit Guide</h3>
            <p class="clip-lines-3">Detroit is not unfamiliar with change and reinvention, and yet for all its complexity, the Motor City is often primarily thought of as the land of automobiles. While this is undeniably a piece of Detroit’s fascinating narrative, the city has a great deal more to offer, particularly in the creative arts, which have long played a prominent role in Detroit’s past (from original urban murals to an iconic record label), and in continuing to shape the ever-changing city today. Museums like MOCAD share the work of brilliant Detroit artists with natives and visitors alike, while also making the case that Detroit is a destination for a diverse, international range of art. Throughout the city, there are extraordinary examples of storied architecture. In rare record shops, music from earlier decades lives on, while contemporary indie bands play in a mix of new venues and old (outrageously awesome) dive bars. Neighborhoods like Midtown (museum district, home to DIA and a transformed retail experience), Downtown (encompasses all of the city’s major stages from economic to operatic and athletic), and Corktown (a hipster dream) have seen waves of new chefs and restaurants come onto the scene. Several new boutique hotels are promised to debut in the next year or two. So, while what in part makes Detroit cool is that it doesn’t have all the familiar amenities and trends of frequently touristed cities, it is undeniably a city of reinvention, and we expect this guide to evolve with it.</p>

            <h3>The Best Gift Shops</h3>
            <p class="clip-lines-3">In the age of Amazon, it’s completely feasible to cross everyone off your list from the comfort of your desk. That said, so long as you don’t find yourself somewhere too overcrowded, there’s really nothing that inspires holiday spirit more than a day spent picking up special, unique pieces for loved ones in person. Here, our favorite shops for perusing with an armful of shopping bags in tow and Christmas music playing in the background (plus a few online favorites for emergencies).</p>

            <h3>Hometown Hero: Pamela Love</h3>
            <p class="clip-lines-3">The New York-based designer, who has had an eponymous jewelry line for nine years, talks the things she loves—from her bagel order at Russ & Daughters to her favorite hotel to tuck into for a staycation—in the city she calls home. Pamela Love‘s resume reads like a true multitasking New Yorker’s: she studied painting and film at NYU, she was a painting assistant for artist Francesco Clemente, and went on to work as an art director and stylist for music videos and films. When she couldn’t find jewelry she liked—for herself or for photo shoots, she started designing it out of her Brooklyn apartment. Now she runs a design and production studio in the heart of New York City’s garment district, where she brings her magpie aesthetic—one part bohemian, one part Southwestern with a dash of rock ’n’ roll—in the form of inlay cuffs, dangling earrings, and long pendants to life. Below, Pamela answers a few hometown superlatives for us.</p>

            <h3>Chef Ford’s Culinary Guide to Miami</h3>
            <p class="clip-lines-3">In cities like Miami, where the food scene is largely dominated by hotel restaurants, it can be difficult for outsiders to separate the truly great menus from the more standard hotel-style fare. Below, the talented Chef Jeremy Ford of the EDITION Hotel’ s amazing Matador (he ‘s also responsible for the dishes at our Miami road-to-table event) separates the good from the great, and shares the places he trusts for the best local produce, coffee, Cuban sandwiches, and more.</p>

            <h3>Miami Road to Table Recap</h3>
            <p class="clip-lines-3">For the Miami edition of our Road to Table series, guests cruised through South Beach in Cadillac XT5s to dinner at the Miami Edition hotel’s Matador Room. Miami is the only stop of the series where we haven’t staged a goop pop-up shop, so each of the dinners (four total, spread out over two fun nights) were full of new friends—chief among them Chef Jeremy Ford of the Matador Room. His gorgeously plated dinner started with a spicy and unexpected shrimp-and-banana appetizer and finished with strawberries served twelve ways. Final stop: LA!</p>

            <h3>The London Guides</h3>
            <p class="clip-lines-3">With our LA and NY guides out of the way, we’ve turned our attention to London, undertaking a seriously comprehensive overhaul and splitting this vast city into six guides, defined loosely by area and character. Take a walk down any London street to discover a span of hundreds of years just in terms of architecture, which is to say these neighborhoods’ roots run seriously deep. From the idyllic and leafy streets of the West and Southwest, to the gritty and ever-evolving neighborhoods of East London, we’ve included all our favorite old haunts, covered the best of the new openings, and added many gems that had somehow escaped our attention. Like always, our guides are alive and changing, and we’re constantly on the lookout for more.</p>

            <h3>Two Great Trips to Kick Off Ski Season</h3>
            <p class="clip-lines-3">While ski resorts are just starting to receive their first snows of the season, nothing’s ski-worthy quite yet—but already we’re daydreaming of wintry cabins, cozy fireplaces, and woolen socks. The good news: ski trips, with all their logistics, are best planned a few months in advance. For some inspiration, we’ve highlighted our favorite spots in two radically different mountain destinations. Austria’s Arlberg region is filled with old-world style and charm, plus all the luxuries required to cater to the glitzy European ski crowd. Meanwhile, Upstate’s Lake Placid (actually much closer to Canada than New York City) has a campy vibe that begs for ‘80s-style pom-pom hats and Fair Isle sweaters. Below, our favorite spots in each place, with the wardrobe to match.</p>

            <p class="clip-lines-3">As far as family vacation destinations go, Iceland is the kind of typographically and culturally extraordinary corner of the earth that captivates both kids and parents from touchdown to takeoff. For GP’s recent trip, Black Tomato—a world-renowned luxury travel company and our trusted resource for planning one-of-a-kind, experience-centric trips—took on the herculean task of building out a five-day itinerary (the capital Reykjavik and its surrounding coastline alone have one hundred-plus square miles of ground to cover, you can easily spend months traversing it all) with as much to do, see, and eat as possible. Each day was brilliantly scheduled out to include multiple stops, from otherworldly volcanic craters to thermal lagoons to lush waterfalls, which sort of felt like landing on several different planets in a span of hours, with plenty of time set aside for the kids to run around and explore. Below, all the highlights.</p>
